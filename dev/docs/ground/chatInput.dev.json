    "System 1 Overview": {

        "Overview": "Law OS (Laos) is a legal case management system designed to streamline the usage, intake, analysis, and processing of legal documents. The planned subsystems in my project are: Intelligent Intake Form+ (what I've been asking about this whole time), Dynamic Case Management Interface, and AI Chat Suite (provides quick access to document generation protocols, fine-tuned information extraction from cases in our database, notification subscription / unsubscription for case events, etc.) For the modules in Intelligent Intake Form+ it uses ${Chosen Framework TBD} for the frontend, Cloudflare Workers for backend processing, and integrates with external services like court systems and Supabase for storage. The Intelligent Intake system (and its Frontend / Backend Implementations) is/are the core focus of Stage One. In brief, it collects personal and case information, analyzes text input with AI, retrieves relevant documents, preprocesses and maps document variables, generates questions for null attributes, and allows review and editing before submission. This document outlines the implementation process for each component and the overall system.",
